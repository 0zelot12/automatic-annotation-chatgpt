1. ACTOR: An ACTOR is an organizational element in a process model diagram that identifies individuals, departments, organizations, or artificial agents responsible for executing an activity. Actors can be categorized as either endogenous, operating within the process owner's boundaries and typically represented by a single actor known as the Actor Performer, or exogenous, involving multiple participants across process boundaries, such as sending and receiving activities. These distinctions are vital in understanding the roles different actors play within a process. Annotation of actors involves capturing entire noun phrases mentioning the actor while excluding unnecessary details, prepositions, punctuation symbols, adverbs, and conjunctions. Actors are annotated only if they are involved in activities, and if mentioned multiple times, each mention is annotated accordingly. When multiple actors are listed, each actor is annotated separately. However, in cases where actors stand in exclusive relations, they are marked within a single annotation. Actors are linked to activities based on their roles, with the Actor Performer being responsible for executing an activity and the Actor Recipient receiving data or triggers from an activity.
2. ACTIVITY: An ACTIVTY refers to a singular unit of work conducted within a process. It encompasses both endogenous activities, which occur within the boundaries of the process owner and are typically represented by tasks in BPMN diagrams, and exogenous activities, which may occur both within and outside these boundaries but impact the process. Activities can be classified as either atomic, representing minimal units of work, or compounded, where activities are further decomposed into sub-activities or described at a high level of detail. Annotation of activities should adhere to specific guidelines, marking only the expression of the activity without including its object, excluding articles and conjunctions at annotation boundaries, and omitting modal verbs when they occur at these boundaries. Additionally, activities may involve linking to Activity Data elements and further specification details, and may involve actors, all of which are captured through specific features in the annotation schema.
3. ACTIVITY_DATA: ACTIVITY_DATA refers to the data or object directly utilized by an activity within a process model diagram. It serves to capture the information regarding what an activity acts upon. The annotation layer called Activity Data is utilized to annotate this process element, with the link between an activity and its corresponding Activity Data annotated in the Behavioral layer. Typically expressed in noun phrases, Activity Data can be described at varying levels of detail, with contiguous important details included in the annotation. However, it is essential to exclude unnecessary details of the object if they are not relevant to the described process. When annotating Activity Data, the entire noun phrase describing the object should be marked, unless the activity is expressed by verbs like "to tell" or "to inform," in which case the entire prepositional phrase, including the preposition, is annotated. In cases where an activity is mentioned several times in the text, all mentions should be annotated consistently. An activity can act on more than one Activity Data, each of which should be marked separately and linked to the activity. Punctuation symbols and conjunctions at the boundary of the annotation span should be excluded from the annotation mark. By the end of the annotation process, every Activity Data must be connected to one or more Activity objects to ensure completeness.
